# bms-radio
Electron wrapper for be-music.surge.sh.

I wrote this app because the website version would stop playing for no reason and I also want to learn about Electron app. (Also Discord RPC is a plus!)

# Download
You can grab a copy from the Release Tab. Or you can compile and build the app by yourself.

# Compile and build
You must have Nodejs installed. 

Open a terminal/command prompt and enter the commands:

```
npm i && node build.js <os_type>
```
While the `<os_type>` could be `win32`, `macintel`, `macarm`, and `linux`.
